# Fields types
A form consists of fields. These fields can be categorised by type. Formalicious is shipped with the most common field-types by default:
* Checkboxes
* Email
* File
* Number
* Radiobuttons
* Select
* Text
* Textarea

All these types have a _Chunk_ associated with them. These can be found in the Elements-tree, below the Formalicious-category. These chunks are optimised voor [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

All the required fields are implemented in Formalicious, but you can change these chunks to match your needs. **It is recommended to duplicate and rename a field before changing it**, because an update of Formalicious will override the original chunks.

## Creating your own field type
All the fields necessary area available by default, but we offer creative freedom here. You can create your own types with your own chunks.

### Step 1: Create the type
Create your type and enter a _Name_ and _Tpl_. The _Value Tpl_ field is only to determine your options for checkbox and radiobutton fields.

The _Validation_ field can be used to use [FormIt validators](https://docs.modx.com/extras/revo/formit/formit.validators).

In the example below we create a field called "Special email", with the template "specialEmailTpl":

![specialEmailTpl Formalicious field-type](https://gawk.es/a/modmore/formalicious/formalicious-100-createfield.png)


### Step 2: Create the associated chunk
We specified the chunk called "specialEmailTpl". This chunk is a regular FormIt-chunk. Please check the [FormIt tutorials](https://docs.modx.com/extras/revo/formit/formit.tutorials-and-examples/) for all your options.

Below is an example of our "Special email Tpl" (copy of emailTpl):

**And that's it, you're all set!**
