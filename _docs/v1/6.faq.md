## I want to setup custom validation per field
This can be accomplished by going to the creating (or editing) a field-type in the admin-panel. You can mention a comma-separated list of FormIt-validators in the _Validation_ field in the dialog-window.

## I don't like the emails sent by Formalicious
Everything is customisable by using chunks or FormIt parameters. First, create a duplicate of the email-chunk (emailFormTpl or fiarTpl) you wish to change and rename it. Then go to the form which should use this new chunk.

Go to the _Advanced_ section and click _Add parameter_. Set the parameter-key to _emailTpl_ or _fiarTpl_ and set the value to the chunk you just made.
