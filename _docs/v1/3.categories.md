# Categories
Organising your forms from the start is highly recommended. You can do this by creating Form-categories. Categories allow you to group forms into tabs.

Create tabs by going to the Formalicious page in the Extras-menu and click on _Admin panel_.

Manage your _Categories_ in the first tab. The category-name will be displayed as the tab-name, followed by the description, which can be used to explain to your users what the category is used for.

**Please be aware:** forms can go missing when removing their parent category. Always make sure a category is empty before removing it. Version 1.1.0 will change this behaviour.
